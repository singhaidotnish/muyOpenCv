1️⃣ Mount Google Drive – Save images directly to Drive.
2️⃣ Enable Webcam – Capture images in real-time.
3️⃣ Save High-Quality Images – Ensure clarity and resolution.
4️⃣ Automate Labeling – Organize data for training.


Step 1: Capture High-Quality Training Data - capture_high_quality_training_data.py

Define the Objects of Interest
Clearly specify the categories of objects you want the model to detect.
Ensure that all possible object variations (shapes, colors, and perspectives) are included.
Diverse and Balanced Dataset
Capture images in various lighting conditions (day, night, indoors, outdoors).
Include different angles, occlusions, and backgrounds to improve generalization.
Balance the dataset to avoid class imbalance, where some classes are overrepresented.
Use High-Resolution Images
Higher-resolution images provide more detail for feature extraction.
However, ensure images are resized properly for computational efficiency.
Include Realistic Contexts
If the object appears in real-world scenes, capture images in such settings.
Ensure both cluttered and clean backgrounds for better generalization.
Augment Data for More Variety
Apply transformations like rotation, flipping, blurring, brightness changes, and scaling.
This helps the model generalize across different environments.


Step 2: Label Data Properly - label_data_properly.py

Use a Reliable Annotation Tool
Tools like LabelImg, Roboflow Annotate, or CVAT help annotate images efficiently.
Choose the Right Annotation Format
Popular formats include YOLO, Pascal VOC (XML), COCO (JSON), and TFRecord (TensorFlow).
Choose a format compatible with your training framework.
Label with Accuracy and Consistency
Ensure bounding boxes tightly fit the objects without excessive margins.
Use the same labels for similar objects (e.g., "car" vs. "automobile" should be standardized).
Handle Occlusions and Partially Visible Objects
Annotate occluded objects properly; include partial bounding boxes where needed.
Validate and Review Annotations
Regularly check annotations for errors and inconsistencies.
Use automated tools or human reviewers for quality assurance.


Step 3: Prepare the Dataset for Training

Split the Data
Training Set (70-80%): Used for learning.
Validation Set (10-15%): Used for hyperparameter tuning.
Test Set (10-15%): Used for evaluating final model performance.
Normalize and Resize Images
Convert images to a consistent size expected by the model.
Normalize pixel values to scale between [0,1] or [-1,1] for better performance.
Check for Labeling Errors
Use visualization tools to inspect labeled data before training.
Look for incorrect bounding boxes, missing labels, or mislabeled objects.


Step 4: Train and Evaluate Your Object Detection Model

Use Transfer Learning (if applicable)
Pretrained models like YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or EfficientDet improve accuracy with less data.
Monitor Training Metrics
Track loss, mean average precision (mAP), recall, and precision to understand model performance.
Refine Data if Needed
If the model performs poorly on certain classes, collect more targeted images for those classes.
By following these steps, you can improve the accuracy of your object detection model through well-captured and well-labeled training data. Let me know if you need further details on any step!
