## NumPy is an essential library for numerical computing in Python, widely used in data science, AI, finance, and engineering. Mastering NumPy will make your code faster, more efficient, and easier to work with.


### Broadcasting and vectorization are two powerful features in NumPy that make operations on arrays efficient and concise. These techniques eliminate the need for explicit loops, making computations faster.


### Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes without explicit looping.


### How Broadcasting Works

When operating on arrays of different shapes, NumPy automatically expands the smaller array to match the shape of the larger one.
Broadcasting Rules

    If the dimensions are the same, no broadcasting is needed.
    If one array has a smaller dimension (1 in a specific axis), it gets expanded to match the larger array.
    Arrays are compatible when one has 1 in a dimension where the other has a larger size.


### What is Vectorization?

ðŸ“Œ Vectorization means performing operations on entire arrays without explicit loops.
This makes operations much faster compared to using Python for loops.



Try these:

    Multiply a 1D array by a 2D array using broadcasting.
    Use vectorization to compute the logarithm of an array.
    Measure the time difference between a loop and NumPy operation.
